Multithreaded server-client model.

*Client

  Client creates a threadpool with minimum 4 maximum 16 threads. Reads a SQL Table, for each row, using a thread, sends a request to the server and waits for a response and writes them both to another sql table.

  There are multiple server implementations each of them has different threading. One of them uses built-in ThreadPool class, one of them uses threads and handles availability for them and the last one is Implements ThreadPool class handles synchronization and availability. All of them have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, simplicity, readability/writeability from case to case.
